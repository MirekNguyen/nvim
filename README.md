# Introduction
This repo is a Neovim configuration for UNIX systems (Linux, MacOS) running Neovim 0.7 and higher.

# Install and Setup
### Prerequisities
* Neovim 0.7 and higher
* Packer via [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

I haven't implemented an installer yet. You have to clone this repository into configuration folder e.g. '~/.config/'.
Install using a command in neovim ':PackerSync' (ignore first error messages after initial start)
